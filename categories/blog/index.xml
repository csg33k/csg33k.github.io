      <description>Create An Application Load Balancer Certificate Manager  Certificate Issuer Certificate   Update Nginx To Enable SSL  Assumptions:
 You have some familiarity with Docker and Kubernetes  NOTE: Any yaml file that&amp;rsquo;s included, please apply it via kubectl apply -f file.yml.
Once you have an application up and running you&amp;rsquo;ll need to ensure it&amp;rsquo;s secure. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore using letsencrypt to enable SSL. It&amp;rsquo;s a free certificate authority and makes it very easy to obtain a certificate.</description>

      <title>Local Email Development Service</title>

      <description>Whenever I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on any application that sends out emails it&amp;rsquo;s always an issue on how to mimic the behavior on my local laptop. Usually wherever the app is deployed is configured to be able to just &amp;lsquo;work&amp;rsquo;. aka you can send email by connecting to localhost with no auth.
Now, how do I mimic locally? In the past i&amp;rsquo;ve tried setting up postfix etc in a docker stack, or more recently doing an smtp relay using google services.</description>

      <description>Home Backup Solution  Choosing Storage Solution Backup Service  Systemd Service     BackUp Data  Encryption Destination Source Schedule Backup Retention   Final Step, Backup Duplicati References/ Requirements  Home Backup Solution I setup a NAS a while ago using Arch Linux and ZFS migrating away from Synology. It&amp;rsquo;s really nice to control your data and be able to use more advanced tooling then the limited set of applications that are available from Synology.</description>

      <description>My most recent experiences though really saddened me and exposed a certain toxicity in the OSS community that I really wish wasn&amp;rsquo;t so prevalent.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting on and off on dev.to but I never introduced myself so let me preface this post with a bit about me to give some context.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using open source and Linux on and off since the early 2000s. My first Linux distribution was Caldera 2.</description>

      <description>IPV4 IPV6  Step 1, enable in the Daemon Step 2, Firewall rules Step 3, Docker Compose + IPV6 Step 4, Resolve NAT Issues   Final thoughts. Unconfirmed Fix  I spent a good bit of time trying to figure this out, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d record this for posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake and others might benefit.
Assumptions:
 You are somewhat familiar with docker You have some exposure with docker-compose You have at least a basic understanding of networking fundamentals.</description>

      <title>Poor Man&#39;s Docker Deployment</title>

      <description>SSL NGINX  NGINX vhost config.   Docker application  Docker Systemd script   Docker Check List. Final stage  I have had several use cases where I want to deploy things in docker for multiple reasons, but ease of deployment is a big one. Low entry bar, less maintenance that makes docker deployment more appealing. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the resources to do a full K8 deployment and ended up with this pattern I wanted to share with others</description>

      <title>Converting Raid 1 to Raid 5 on Linux file systems</title>
      <link>https://www.esamir.com/20/8/22/converting-raid-1-to-raid-5-on-linux-file-systems/</link>

      <description>Converting from Raid 1 to Raid 5 This assumes you have a functional Raid 1 and wish to convert it to a Raid 5.
Disclaimer: At some point during this process I realized that I had a bad mother board. The reason my /dev/sdd1 failed wasn&amp;rsquo;t the drive, but the bus on the board. That being said, this is the unverified procedure.
I&amp;rsquo;m running on Ubuntu 12.10 but you should be able to do this on any modern Linux distribution.</description>
