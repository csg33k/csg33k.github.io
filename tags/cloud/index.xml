      <description>Home Backup Solution I setup a NAS a while ago using Arch Linux and ZFS migrating away from Synology. It&amp;rsquo;s really nice to control your data and be able to use more advanced tooling then the limited set of applications that are available from Synology.
I had S3 backups setup with Synology and wanted to create something similar on the Arch Server.
I have about 3 TB of data I want to backup and was looking for something that&amp;rsquo;s secure and is a bit more intelligent than a crontab of aws sync.</description>
