      <description>Home Backup Solution I setup a NAS a while ago using Arch Linux and ZFS migrating away from Synology. It&amp;rsquo;s really nice to control your data and be able to use more advanced tooling then the limited set of applications that are available from Synology.
I had S3 backups setup with Synology and wanted to create something similar on the Arch Server.
I have about 3 TB of data I want to backup and was looking for something that&amp;rsquo;s secure and is a bit more intelligent than a crontab of aws sync.</description>

      <description>My most recent experiences though really saddened me and exposed a certain toxicity in the OSS community that I really wish wasn&amp;rsquo;t so prevalent.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting on and off on dev.to but I never introduced myself so let me preface this post with a bit about me to give some context.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using open source and Linux on and off since the early 2000s. My first Linux distro was Caldera 2.</description>

      <description>Intro I’ve been using open source and Linux on and off since the early 2000s. My first Linux distro was Caldera 2.4 an old RPM based that was cool in its hayday and then turned towards the dark side with various different lawsuits against Linux that never went anywhere.
I’ve been involved in more Linux Users Groups, mailing lists and conferences then I can count. I helped start a Linux conference that’s been running for a good while after I graduated educating and teaching people about the benefits of Linux and Open Source.</description>

      <description>I spent a good bit of time trying to figure this out, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d record this for posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake and others might benefit.
Assumptions:
 You are somewhat familiar with docker You have some exposure with docker-compose You have at least a basic understanding of networking fundamentals. I&amp;rsquo;m not a networking expert but you should have an understanding of TCP, the existence of IPV4 and IPV6 and how they differ.</description>

      <title>Poor Man&#39;s Docker Deployment</title>

      <description>I have had several use cases where I want to deploy things in docker for multiple reasons, but ease of deployment is a big one. Low entry bar, less maintenance that makes docker deployment more appealing. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the resources to do a full K8 deployment and ended up with this pattern I wanted to share with others
Assumptions:
 You are somewhat familiar with docker You have some exposure with docker-compose You know what systemd, init.</description>

      <title>Converting Raid 1 to Raid 5 on Linux file systems</title>
      <link>https://www.esamir.com/post/posts/raid_convertion_guide/</link>

      <description>Converting from Raid 1 to Raid 5 This assumes you have a functional Raid 1 and wish to convert it to a Raid 5.
Disclaimer: At some point during this process I realized that I had a bad mother board. The reason my /dev/sdd1 failed wasn&amp;rsquo;t the drive, but the bus on the board. That being said, this is the unverified procedure.
I&amp;rsquo;m running on Ubuntu 12.10 but you should be able to do this on any modern Linux distribution.</description>
